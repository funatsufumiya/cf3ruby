# cf3ruby

**context-free DSL for ruby-1.9 and CF3 syntax** 

Very much derived from [context-free.rb][] by Jeremy Ashkenas this version is updated to be more in line with CF3 and ruby 1.9 syntax. Tested as working with last rubygems release of ruby-processing (v 1.0.11) as well as the current [version][] (v 2.1.0).
