# cf3ruby

**context-free DSL for ruby-1.9 and CF3 syntax** 

Very much derived from [context-free.rb][] by Jeremy Ashkenas this version is updated to be more in line with CF3 and ruby 1.9 syntax. Tested as working with last rubygems release of ruby-processing (v 1.0.11) as well as the current [version][] (v 2.1.0).

## Installation

To use this library you need install jruby (preferably jruby-1.7.4+), you will also need ruby-prcessing to be installed (minimum version 1.0.11, preferred version 2.1.0). Either clone this repository, or download a snapshot.

```bash
cd cf3ruby 
jruby -S rake test # builds and tests gem (mouse click on frame for test image to show)
jruby -S install cf3-0.0.1.gem # may need sudo access
```

I'm working on bundler and or rubygems installation
