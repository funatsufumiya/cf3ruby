v0.0.2 Second Gem Release
  * extract samples to cf3work/samples, was cf3samples/samples
  * gives me an opportunity to create a lock for bundler?


v0.0.1. First Gem Release
  * very much base on jashkenas context-free.rb updated
  * for ruby-1.9 syntax (and DSL nearer to CF3 than the original cfdg)
